## Implementation of the SDF Loss

In this package we provide a CUDA implementation of the SDF computation as well as of the SDF-based collision function.

## Installation instructions

You can install the package by running the setup script. Before doing so verify the compiler, the gcc and the g++ versions!:
```
python setup.py install
```

GIVEN that the TORCH version I am using is way newer than torch 1.1 used
in this CRMH (Jiang et.al) code: 
You have to change the C code: 
check https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer/pull/86/files 

change AT_CHECK for TORCH_CHECK

Our SDF CUDA kernels are based on the [original](https://github.com/davidstutz/mesh-voxelization) C++ implementation by [David Stutz](https://github.com/davidstutz).
